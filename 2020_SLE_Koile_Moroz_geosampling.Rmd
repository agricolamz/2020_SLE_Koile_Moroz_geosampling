## Outline of the talk

## Introduction
* Geolectal variation is often present in settings where one language is spoken across a vast geographic area ( @labov1963social ). 
* It can be found in phonological, morphosyntactic, and lexical features. 
* Often overlooked by linguists ( @dorian10 ). 

**ADD SOME MAPS**

## The problem

* Let us consider a geolectal continuum formed by a group of small vilages ( @chambers1998dialectology )

**FLAT MAP OF VILLAGES**

* We are interested in spotting variation of a certain parameter among the lects spoken on these villages

**MAP OF FEATURE ON VILLAGES**

* We will very unlikely be able to conduct fieldwork in each single village. Therefore, we need to choose a *sample* of locations.

* *Research Question*: How to choose the sample of villages to survey? 
    * 1) How many villages is enough for spotting variation? 
    * 2) Given an amount of sampled villages, how to decide which ones are representative of our population?

# Our approach

* We assume that we want to find the distribution of variation for one feature, and we try different ways of choosing the sampled villages for finding it:

* As we assume we don't have any data beyond the geographic location of each village, we use these locations for building our sample

* We generate clusters with different algorithms (k-means, hierarchical clustering) and pick our sampled locations based on them (package stats, @team2013r).

* We compare our results with random sampling for two different scenarios: 
    * Binary categories for simulated data with different distributions
    * Multiple categorical data for Circassian languages



## Simulated data

* total number of locations (*N*): $20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120$
* type of spatial relations:
    * random
    * two more or less separable regions
    * central and periphery
* proportion of variation in the explored variable (*p*): $0.1, 0.2, \dots 0.5$
* amount of clusters (*k*): $0.1\times N, 0.2\times N, \dots 0.9\times N$
* percantage of observations taken from each cluster (*r*): $0.1, 0.2, \dots 0.9$

From  those values we could derive a number of sampled locations (n):

$$n = \frac{N\times r}{k}$$
